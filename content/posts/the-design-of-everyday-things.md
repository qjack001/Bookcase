For anyone who designs anything to be used by humansâ€”from physical objects to computer programs to conceptual tools. Forever changing how you experience and interact with your physical surroundings, opening your eyes to the perversity of bad design, & raising your expectations about how things *should* be designed, Norman's work has remained a foundational text in the world of design.
