*OfficeUS* reframes the history of U.S. architecture through the lens of export in two interrelated constructs: The Office and The Repository. Together, these two halves of *OfficeUS* create both an historical record of the U.S. contribution to global architectural thought, and a petri dish in which that record is submitted to contemporary agents of disruption and critique.
