During his nearly forty years as a music journalist, Ralph J. Gleason recorded many in-depth interviews with some of the greatest jazz musicians of all time. These informal sessions, conducted mostly in Gleasonâ€™s Berkeley, California, home, have never been transcribed and published in full until now.
