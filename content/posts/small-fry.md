The daughter of artist Chrisann Brennan and Steve Jobs, Lisa's childhood unfolded in a rapidly changing Silicon Valley. A mythical figure, rarely present when she was young, Lisa's father took an interest in her as she grew older. Ushering her into a new world of mansions, vacations, and private schools, Lisa decided to move in with her father, hoping he'd become the parent she'd always wanted him to be.
