Born in Switzerland in 1943, Mario Botta is a leading member of the Swiss-Italian Ticino school of Architecture. Equally comfortable working on a large scale or with smaller, more intimate projects, he is a maestro when it comes to fusing the strengths of Modernism with the tried and tested forms of tradition.
